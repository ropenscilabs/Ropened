**What makes a good educational resource for teaching science with R**

For instructors teaching sciences with R, there are a number of open educational resources that they can reuse, tailor to their own teaching style, or use to inspire them in creating their own materials. Four examples are [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R (a.k.a. STAT545)](http://stat545.com/) originally developed by Jenny Bryan, [Data science course in a box](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and [Statistics and R](http://rafalab.github.io/pages/harvardx.html) by Rafael Irizarry and Michael Love and the lessons offered by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), including [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) which are domain agnostic, and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) which are domain specific. What makes these teaching materials appealing for educators?

For starters, curricular material for teaching must be open to be available and discoverable by other educators. However, a common belief is that educational resources that are closed are better than any open material can ever be. Otherwise, why would someone pay for educational materials? While there are surely cases of closed educational resources that are excellent, openness is one of the most appealing characteristics of high quality teaching resources for teaching sciences with R. Open materials also have no cost for students, allow a community of educators and students to improve and update the materials, and make it possible to reuse and adapt resources. All this makes the whole teaching experience a lot more efficient for the education community at large. In the closed model, where educators do not share their materials openly, they are often working alone (or in small groups) without any feedback nor the contribution of a nurturing community.

Another desirable characteristic of good curriculum material is that teaching materials work best when built following education research about how humans learn. Scholars have rigorous formal training in research, which is then peer reviewed. When it comes to teaching, they have little to no formal training in educational practices and research. Also, formal mechanisms for peer review are scarce to null. For instance, educational research suggests that learners need help building a mental concept map  which is incrementally completed as a course progresses. Or, to take other principles of human learning, human working memory can handle on average five concepts at a time, humans find stories appealing and memorable, and there is a short span of attention during which a learner can incorporate new materials. (These and other findings from education research can be found at [Greg Wilson’s “How to Teach Programming (and Other Things)”](http://third-bit.com/teaching/).)

Courses that are developed using examples based on real data from the domain of interest and that are meaningful to the learner tend to be more successful teaching contents. Particularly when focusing in the actual practice of the concepts taught rather on purely focusing on the theory. Practice initially using groups of three persons, then two persons and then finally working on the materials individually is also a good way to transmit contents that are initially challenging. A parallel scheme is to introduce the new concepts using a spiral technique that repeats the new concepts over the course using an increased level of difficulty. Platforms for course materials also contribute to their quality and maximize their openness and possibilities of reaching out to more interested parties. Tools such as R markdown, blogdown, bookdown, or the DataCamp.com course development platform are good examples of tools that are helpful at developing good open resources to teach science with R.

Another feature of good course materials is that they teach people to be independent. Courses that focus in step-by-step instructions toward a topic, usually fall short to be as helpful in real life as courses that teach concepts that generalize to uses outside the classroom. In real life it is more important to know what questions to ask, how to find good answers to those questions, and how to keep the knowledge acquired up to date than to follow step-by-step tutorials for a procedure that may age.

How these learning aims are met, either as apart of a formal term long course, or in a short burst, like a two day workshop, can impact what makes good course materials. For a term long course, lessons that can be woven into existing courses may be more useful, where as teaching a certain set of R skills in a short burst may benefit from a more formal set of lessons that have been tested in an intensive workshop experience. 

In the following and last post for this series, we summarize some priority needs and call for action to advance these priorities to further resources teaching sciences with R.
